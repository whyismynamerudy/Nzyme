# N:zyme
An academic text summarization and information extraction tool to aid in active recall.

## Inspiration
Sometimes contents in a textbook can be dry and wordy. Is there a way to process this information like how enzymes process their chemical reaction in a more efficient and faster way? Introducing N:zyme, your little enzyme friend that will help you study the material in no time!

## What it does
Import your textbook pdf, or copy and paste a chapter of it. Using language models and machine learning, N:zyme will compute the important takeaways for each textbook chapter in a concise yet detailed summary. The summary is also accompanied by relevant pictures to aid students who are visual learners. All the saved summaries can be used for N:zyme's active recall section. Active recall is a study method which demonstrated to be the most effective according to research on different studying techniques. Students will test their knowledge of the material by inputting keywords/phrases they remembered and N:zyme will compare it with its saved summary.

## What's next for N:zyme
What's next for N:zyme would be to implement voice recognition to text for learners who want to record their professors during lecture, as well to implement the ability for users to upload screenshots or PDFs of their textbook to automatically summarize the information contained within the media. We also want to work with the premium version of the Co:here API which allows more features and access to better NLP models for enhanced user experiences. Finally, we want to continue expanding on the "active recall" functionality of our application by adding an interactive section wherein users can quiz themselves on the summarized text by filling in the blanks, etc.
